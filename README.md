# Fitness Shuffle
 An Instagram filter that chooses an exercise for you to do. 
 
## Inspiration

Fitness is important to your long term health and well being. This filter selects an execise that you can do at home! I hope to start a 30 day fitness challenge where people can do atleast 1-3 exercises a day.

## What it does

This filter shuffles through different time intervals and and exercises to select one combination for you to do. Example: 10 jumping jacks or 30 minute walk.

## How I built it

I built it by leveraging the Spark AR Head Decoration template to start then using Affinity Designer to create all the assets. 

## Challenges I ran into

I ran into an issue getting the two shuffling panes aligned. One kepts looking darker than the other. I have not been able to resolve that yet.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

I am most proud of getting the basic effect working in only a few hours although. I am also proud of creating such clean and professional looking assets.

## What I learned

I learn a lot about where to find affordable icons. I used icons from the [Nouns Project](https://thenounproject.com/guimoide/collection/fitness-exercises-solid/) for this filter.


## What's next for Plants at Home

- Update the prompt to be about exercise
- Use compression to reduce assets sizes if needed)(
- Create a demo video
- Publish for review on Instagram and Facebook
